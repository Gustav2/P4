So to run the two test we can:

First, before test run:
make clean && make

Test the speed in terminal, will auto close after 300 ms, if no data, will also close if no usb found:
./build/extcap_uart

Hexdump test in terminal, will auto close after 300 ms, if no data, will also close if no usb found (use two terminals one to run and one to show):
First terminal:
./build/extcap_uart --capture --fifo=test.fifo

Second terminal:
cat test.fifo | hexdump -C
